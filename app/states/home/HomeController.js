I've spent most of my time in college supplementing my studies with an amazing job at the Digital Corps which has allowed me to gather software development experience that I couldn't get in the classroom. I have learned how to work with teams that include other developers as well as people from other disciplines like design or video. While most of my recent work has been front-end web development, I have a drive to do more and branch out. Learning new tools or methods has become a thrill for me. Aside from web development, I have a worked on a few apps that have been published to either the App Store or Play Store and wish to continue working with and learning more about native mobile development in future either as a job or on my own.";
