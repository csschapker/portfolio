I've spent most of my time in college supplementing my studies with an amazing job at the Digital Corps which has allowed me to gather software development experience that I couldn't get in the classroom. I have learned how to work with teams that include other developers as well as people from other disciplines like design or video. While most of my recent work has been front-end web development, I have a drive to do more and branch out. Learning new tools or methods has become a thrill for me. Aside from web development, I have a worked on a few apps that have been published to either the App Store or Play Store and wish to continue working with and learning more about native mobile development in future either as a job or on my own. In recent months, I started practicing a new skill that has always excited me and that I hope in improve upon after graduation. This skill is graphic design (mostly ux/ui design), and while I'm still very much a beginner, I feel like my time working at the Digital Corps with many talented designers has given me a head start.";
        $scope.aboutMe = "Now, enough about my work, let me tell you a little about who I am. I’d say that I’m a quiet, generally humble guy who dislikes being the center of attention, especially in a group setting. Once you finally get me to start talking, though, I like to joke around and have good time. I always try to produce my work that is better than my last, but I always try to avoid taking myself too seriously. Most importantly, I’m always willing to learn more. I may not be the most adventurous person you’ve met, but I like to try new things. After all, how am I supposed to do and see everything if I don’t try anything new?";
