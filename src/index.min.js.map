The system we built uses data from the O*NET occupation database and allows users to take a couple routes for finding job information. First, they can browse through a simple list of occupations, sorting by salary or name, and save any they might find interesting. Another option the user has is to answer a short survey, picking two of their values or personality types that they find most important. The results of the survey are used to present the user with a list of careers that they might be interested in and can also save for later. The last part of the application allows users to enter an email address to receive the information about careers they saved and additional information from the Career Center.',\n            role: 'Most of my work on the kiosk application was on the front end.

This turned into one of the most interesting and fun projects I have worked on. The idea was to make a web-based assignment that didn’t just make students answer questions (although they still get to, of course), but made them pull from their knowledge and apply it to the real world. The solution was to ask the students to plan for a simulated youth soccer camp to see if, given a certain budget, they would hire the appropriate amount of staff as well as equipment. The students would need to pick out the items and personnel they needed and distribute them among the different fields of the soccer camp. After doing so, they would be presented a few prompts about things that could potentially go wrong and answer how they would respond to those situations.',\n            role: 'With this project, my work has been evenly distributed between the front end and back end.

While most of my recent work has been front-end web development, I have a drive to do more and branch out. Learning new tools or methods has become a thrill for me. Aside from web development, I have a worked on a few apps that have been published to either the App Store or Play Store and wish to continue working with and learning more about native mobile development in future either as a job or on my own. In recent months, I started practicing a new skill that has always excited me and that I hope in improve upon after graduation.
