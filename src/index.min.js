The BSU Campus Map showed all of the buildings on campus and some information about each one. Well by the summer of 2015 the applications were very outdated, sometimes struggling to run as the systems they were designed on were being dropped. So we started a project to redesign the applications and revamp the system as whole with more accurate and more useful information. The apps now show the entities closest to the user’s location and more detailed information about each building. When a user views a building, they can get directions to it and find out what offices, dining areas and labs are in it. Users can also the normal hours of operation for most places on campus. There are also indicators of what is in a building and where restrooms are located. Additionally, users can find parking lots and meters, landmarks and ATMs. You can view the Android app <a title="View on Play Store" target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.bsu.campusmap">here</a>.',role:"This project is one my favorites from my time at the Digital Corps because it’s used daily by many students around Ball State’s campus, and I have used it often myself.

Overall, I spent most of my time working on interactions with map, such as showing and hiding the appropriate markers at the appropriate times and getting the proper animations out of the map.

Another option the user has is to answer a short survey, picking two of their values or personality types that they find most important.

The solution was to ask the students to plan for a simulated youth soccer camp to see if, given a certain budget, they would hire the appropriate amount of staff as well as equipment. The students would need to pick out the items and personnel they needed and distribute them among the different fields of the soccer camp. After doing so, they would be presented a few prompts about things that could potentially go wrong and answer how they would respond to those situations.",role:"With this project, my work has been evenly distributed between the front end and back end.

Aside from web development, I have a worked on a few apps that have been published to either the App Store or Play Store and wish to continue working with and learning more about native mobile development in future either as a job or on my own. In recent months, I started practicing a new skill that has always excited me and that I hope in improve upon after graduation.
